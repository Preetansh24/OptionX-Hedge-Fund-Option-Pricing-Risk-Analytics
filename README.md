## ✨ Project Overview

This project is a **professional-grade option pricing and risk analysis system** designed to help hedge funds and quantitative analysts **understand, price, and manage option positions** using real market data.

It bridges the gap between **theoretical finance** and **practical decision-making**, translating complex quantitative metrics into **clear, intuitive, and actionable insights** for portfolio managers.

> 🧠 Built with the mindset of a **buy-side hedge fund analyst**, this project emphasizes clarity, realism, and strategic thinking.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

✔ Estimate **fair value** of live option contracts  
✔ Compare **model price vs market price**  
✔ Understand **time decay & volatility impact**  
✔ Interpret **Greeks in plain English**  
✔ Identify **key risks** in an option position  
✔ Propose **realistic hedging strategies**  
✔ Deliver **consulting-style recommendations**

- AAPL  
- MSFT  
- NVDA

## ⚙️ Methodology Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Option Pricing

- Uses **Black–Scholes intuition**
- Prices **live call or put options**
- Compares:
  - 📌 Model Price  
  - 📌 Market Price  
- Explains **mispricing reasons**, such as:
  - Volatility mismatch  
  - Market sentiment  
  - Demand–supply imbalance  
  - Model limitations  

---

### 2️⃣ Greeks – Explained Simply

| Greek | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Delta** | Price sensitivity to stock movement | Directional risk |
| **Theta** | Value lost per day | Time decay risk |
| **Vega** | Sensitivity to volatility | Uncertainty risk |

Each Greek is:
- Computed numerically
- Explained **without heavy mathematics**
- Supported with **intuitive examples**

---

### 3️⃣ Risk Identification

The system clearly highlights:
- 📉 **Directional risk** (Delta exposure)
- ⏳ **Time decay risk** (Theta erosion)
- 🌪 **Volatility risk** (Vega sensitivity)

No abstract theory — only **practical risk awareness**.

---

### 4️⃣ Hedging Strategy

A **realistic hedge** is proposed using:
- The **underlying stock**
- Delta-neutral positioning
- Continuous monitoring framework

> This mirrors how real hedge funds manage option books.

---

## 📝 Consulting-Style Recommendation

The final output includes a **one-page memo** written for a **non-technical portfolio manager**, covering:

- Is the option **cheap or expensive**?
- What are the **primary risks**?
- How should the position be **managed or hedged**?
- What should be **monitored daily**?

Clear. Concise. Decision-focused.

---

## 📊 Deliverables

✔ 9-slide professional presentation  
✔ Pricing comparison visuals  
✔ Greeks interpretation  
✔ Risk & hedge explanation  
✔ Consulting summary memo  

Designed to **win academic, corporate, and competition evaluations**.
